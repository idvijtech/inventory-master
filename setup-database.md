Here's a paraphrased version of the developer guide for migrating to a PostgreSQL database:

Project Database Migration: Switching to PostgreSQL for Persistent Data
This document outlines the transition of the application's data persistence from in-memory storage to a PostgreSQL database, enabling robust and scalable data management.

I. Core Migration Changes:

Environment Configuration:

A .env file now stores the DATABASE_URL (e.g., postgresql://user:pass@host:port/database_name).

New dependencies like pg (PostgreSQL client) and dotenv are installed alongside drizzle-orm for database interactions.

Database Connection:

The server/db.ts file is updated to connect to PostgreSQL using the DATABASE_URL and export a database instance for use across the backend.

Storage Layer Update:

The server/storage.ts module now uses a new PgStorage class, which handles all database operations via PostgreSQL. This replaces the old in-memory storage, ensuring all data is now persistently stored.

Backend Functionality:

Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and querying support has been implemented for key entities including Users, Categories, Products, Suppliers, Customers, Inventory Transactions, Sales Orders, Purchase Orders, Returns, Payments, Notifications, and Dashboard Statistics using PostgreSQL.

Note: Some advanced analytics methods are placeholders for future implementation.

Application Impact:

All API endpoints now consistently store and retrieve data from the PostgreSQL database, meaning data is no longer lost when the server restarts.

The application is now production-ready with a persistent database backend.

II. Next Steps (Post-Migration):

Implement remaining database methods for other entities or advanced features (e.g., full sales order CRUD, comprehensive analytics).

Add database migration scripts for schema changes and data seeding scripts if needed.

Thoroughly test all API endpoints and user interface flows to ensure seamless integration.

Database Setup & Troubleshooting Guide
This guide addresses common "500 Internal Server Errors" due to missing DATABASE_URL and provides steps to set up your PostgreSQL database.

I. Problem:

The application generates 500 errors because it cannot connect to the PostgreSQL database; the DATABASE_URL environment variable is not set.

II. Solutions for Database Setup:

Local PostgreSQL:

Install PostgreSQL on your machine.

Create a database (e.g., CREATE DATABASE inventory;).

Set the DATABASE_URL environment variable using your database credentials (e.g., postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/inventory_master).

Cloud PostgreSQL (Recommended for ease of setup):

Use services like Neon, Supabase, or Railway.

Sign up, create a new PostgreSQL project/service, and copy the provided connection string.

Set this connection string as your DATABASE_URL.

Temporary SQLite (Development Only):

For quick local development, you can temporarily modify the application to use SQLite instead of PostgreSQL. (Specific steps for this modification would be in the original guide.)

III. Setting the DATABASE_URL Environment Variable:

Temporary (Command Line):

Windows PowerShell: $env:DATABASE_URL="your_connection_string" then npm run dev

Windows Command Prompt: set DATABASE_URL=your_connection_string then npm run dev

Permanent (Local Development):

Create a file named .env in your project's root directory.

Add DATABASE_URL=your_connection_string_here to this file.

IV. Database Schema Setup:

After configuring the database connection, use Drizzle ORM to create the necessary tables by running:

npx drizzle-kit push

V. Testing the Connection:

Restart your development server after setup: npm run dev

VI. Troubleshooting Common Issues:

"Connection refused": Verify PostgreSQL is running and the port is correct.

"Authentication failed": Double-check your username and password.

"Database does not exist": Ensure you've created the database.

"Permission denied": Confirm your database user has the necessary access rights.

VII. Example Connection Strings:

Local PostgreSQL: postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/inventory_master

Neon: postgresql://username:password@ep-xxx-xxx.region.aws.neon.tech/database

Supabase: postgresql://postgres:password@db.xxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres
